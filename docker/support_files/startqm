# This script is the entry point for our Docker container. It will start
# ScarletDME, then run supervisord (which will in turn manage running xinetd,
# sshd, and any other daemons we add in the future). It will then wait for
# supervisord to end, since when this script ends the whole Docker container
# terminates.
#
# We trap SIGTERM and SIGINT to handle receiving the stop signal from Docker,
# or a user hitting Ctrl-C if we're in the foreground. We kill supervisord,
# wait for it to finish, then stop ScarletDME.
